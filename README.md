FlowBuilder App

Vision:
Our vision is to empower users in automating and optimizing their work processes through a user-friendly app that allows the creation of custom flows.

Background:
As businesses undergo digitalization, the need for efficient, automated processes becomes crucial. Our app addresses this by providing stakeholders with the ability to create and customize flows tailored to their specific requirements.

Goal:
The goal is to develop a versatile process builder that enables users to seamlessly construct linear flows using a variety of predefined steps.

Types of Steps:

Title Step: Takes a title and subtitle as input.

Text Step: Requires a title and copy (text).

Text Input Step: Expects a description of the expected input.

Number Input Step: Expects a description for the expected numeric input.

Calculus Step: Performs mathematical operations on previous number input steps.

Display Step: Displays content from previous text or CSV input steps.

Text File Input Step: Allows the addition of .txt files.

CSV File Input Step: Allows the addition of .csv files.

Output Step: Generates a text file as output, customizable with information from previous steps.

End Step: Marks the end of a flow.

User Stories:
